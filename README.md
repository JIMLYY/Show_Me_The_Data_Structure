# Show_Me_The_Data_Structure
## Introduction 
This project is a part of Data Structure and Algorithms Nanodegree at Udacity. In this project, I have been given six questions.
These questions cover a variety of topics related to data structures I have learned in this course, such as queue, linked list,
tree and so on. I need to write up clean and efficinet solutions in python 3, and a text explanation of efficiency and
design choices of the code is also required. 

## Required Skills 
* Intermediate level of Python 3 (being confortable with class, dictionary, lambda function and etc.) 
* Good understanding of data structure such as queue, linked list, tree and etc.
* Being able to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms

## Test 
* Clone or download this repo in ``` https://github.com/JIMLYY/Show_Me_The_Data_Structure.git```. To clone the repo:

  - In your command line, type in: ``` git clone https://github.com/JIMLYY/Show_Me_The_Data_Structure.git```

## Want to try? 
* Detailed description has been provided in this repo. If you want to try it for yourself, you are encouraged to come up with 
the solutions from scratch.




* Happy coding :rocket::rocket:

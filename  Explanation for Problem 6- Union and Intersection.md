### Explanation for Problem 6: Union and Intersection
1. Data structure
Linked list, set
2. Explanation: the solution is not hard to come up with. Basically, we can take advantage of python's set(). Then traverse list_1 and list_2 respectively. Then construct a new linked list based on the value in set.

_The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B._

_Time complexity is O(n). Space complexity is O(n)._
